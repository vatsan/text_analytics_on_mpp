I don't instinctively thing vegetarianism is right (the same way I\\ninstinctively feel torture is wrong), but if I thought about it long enough and\\nlistened to the arguments, I could perhaps reason that it was wrong (is that\\npossible!?  :) )  See the difference?\\n\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Also, consensus positions fall to a might makes right.

What\\n#&gt;right do we have to expect others to follow our notion of societally\\n#&gt;mandated morality?  Pardon the extremism, but couldn't I murder your\\n#&gt;\"brother\" and say that I was exercising my rights as I saw them, was\\n#&gt;doing what felt good, didn't want anyone forcing their morality on me,\\n#&gt;or I don't follow your \"morality\" ?\\n# \\n#I believe that morality is subjective.  Each person is entitled to his\\n#own moral attitudes.  Mine are not a priori more correct than someone\\n#elses.  This does not mean however that I must judge another on the\\n#basis of his rather than my moral standards.  While he is entitled to\\n#believe what his own moral sense tells him, the rest of society is\\n#entitled to pass laws spelling out punishments for behavior that is\\n#offensive to the majority.\\n\\nWhy?  Your last statement.  Why?  By which authority?  \\n\\n#Most criminals do not see their behavior as moral.  The may realize that\\n#it is immoral and not care.  They are thus not following their own moral\\n#system but being immoral.  For someone to lay claim to an alternative\\n#moral system, he must be sincere in his belief in it and it must be\\n#internally consistent.  \\n\\nWhy?  Your last statement.  Why are these things necessary?  \\n\\nAnd believe me, a belief in terrorism can be both sincere and frighteningly\\nconsistent.\\n\\n#Some sociopaths lack an innate moral sense and\\n#thus may be incapable of behaving morally.  While someone like Hitler\\n#may have believed that his actions were moral, we may judge him immoral\\n#by our standards.  Holding that morality is subjective does not mean\\n#that we must excuse the murderer.\\n\\nTrouble is, this would sound just fine coming from someone like Hitler, too.\\n(I do *not* mean any comparison or offence, David.)
